\aboutme{
I would like to introduce myself as a person of integrity, commitment and capability. Throughout my career as a software developer, I was working on a wide range of technologies and was driving results regardless of the domain. Being responsible about each item on my work schedule is something that I would never quit. Climbing higher up on the career ladder is all about connecting the dots and creating the bigger picture is something that I always believe in and work towards.
